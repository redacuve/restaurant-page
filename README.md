<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
## How it Works

This webpage is built with pure Javascript, it needs webpack to proper use because has lots of imports, the navbar, footer, and pages (about, menu, home, find) have its own .js file, every .js file is located inside /src folder, the images are inside /src/img folder.

### Running the code

*   Navigate to the root directory of the project

*   Run this command on your terminal to add all the required packages and dependencies
    ```
    $ npm install
    ```
*   Also, you can build this webpage for production, this app it's going to be saved inside the /dist folder, here we can see a main.js file, this is a minified file of the previous files o¿inside /src folder.
    ```
    $ npm run build
    ```
*   Now the app is ready, you can open the index.html inside /dist folder.
